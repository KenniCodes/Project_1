    <h2>Core Pokémon Games</h2>
    <p>Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire version were released on the Gameboy Advance in 2002, later the following year Pokémon Emerald was released. These are the only core series Pokémon games in generation III. The story takes place in the Hoenn region
      which is inspired by the Kyushu island of Japan. As usual the
      plot is the same as previous
      generations with the protagonist obtaining all the Pokémon (202 in this region), challenging 8 gym leaders, the Elite Four and the Champion, all while being interupted by an evil organization along the way (Team Aqua in Pokémon Sapphire and
      Team
      Magma in Pokémon Ruby). Team Aqua and Team Magma
      replace Team Rocket as the evil organization in this region, however their goal remains the same (to capture the region's legendary Pokémon for world domination). Pokémon Emerald is slightly different to it's predecessors but more or less the
      same in terms of gameplay.</p>

  <h3>Pokémon Contests</h3>
  <p>Introduced in the Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire versions, Pokémon contests are competitions of style between Pokémon and their trainers. Within this there are five categories: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough and Smart. Also there are ranks along with each category, they are: Normal, Super, Hyper and Master rank. Each contest is broken down into two rounds, the first round is an "Appeal round" where Pokémon are rated based on appearance. The second round is an "Acting round" where Pokémon perform four moves each and are given ratings by the judges. Then at the end all the points are tallied up and the winning Pokémon gets a ribbon.</p>
  <h3>Battle Frontier</h3>
  <p>Pokémon Emerald version introduced the Battle Frontier, replacing the Battle Tower which was introduced in Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire. The Battle Frontier is challenge beyond the championship title. Starting off with a series of trainers that must be defeated in succession. The player has to lock in one set party of Pokémon that cannot be changed until the streak ends either voluntarily or by loss in battle, while each trainer brings a unique team to battle. Once a set number of trainers are defeated, a Frontier Brain (equivalent to Elite Four) will challenge the player. Defeating a Frontier Brain grants the player's Pokémon team a ribbon to mark the achievement. Also along the way, the player is awarded Battle Points after each win which can be spent on unique items within the Battle Frontier's shop only.</p>
  <h3>Pokémon Abilities & Natures</h3>
  <p>With the introduction of abilities, Pokémon now have a new dynamic in battles. Pokémon abilities are passive and can range from situational (ex. when hit with water type move, restore HP), to continous (increases chances of additional effects to activate when attacking), to immunity and many more types of.<br><br> Pokémon natures on the other hand affects the statistics of Pokémon, there are 25 in total. Each nature has a 10% boost to specific stat and 10% reduction to a different specific stat. However there are five natures that have virtually no boost or reduction. Natures are a completely random variable, meaning that Pokémon of the same species can have different natures. The way to change a Pokémon's nature is to catch the same species and hope it's different or breed it, if possible, then check if it has a different nature when it hatches.</p>

  <h3>Double & Multi Battles</h3>
  <p>Up until this generation Pokémon battles were 1 vs 1, then with the release of Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire version some Pokémon battles can be 2 vs 2. This meant that each player can send out two Pokémon to battle simultaneously. This dramatically changes the strategy of battles now that players can create synergy with their Pokémon teams when playing in the 2 vs 2 format.<br><br>Multi battles is slightly different in that there are four players divided into teams of two and in control of one Pokémon each but the battle format remains 2 vs 2.</p>
  <h3>Secret Bases</h3>
  <p>Throughout the Hoenn region there are many trees, caves, etc. that can only be accessed through the move "Hidden Power". These are called secret bases and they can be decorated with furniture, plushies, trophies and more. Players can claim these secret bases and when linked to other players via the link cable they can visit each other's secret base. Decorations can be obtained through various means and placed anywhere within their secret base.</p>
  <!-- Reason for being my favourite -->
  <h1>Why this is my favourite generation</h1>
  <p>Generation III is my favourite because at the time it was the first core series Pokémon game to have such a steep learning curve to competitive Pokémon battles plus an amazing soundtrack, vibrant art design plus plenty of postgame content for replay value.<br><br> To expand on the competitive changes to this generation, the introduction of Pokémon abilities significantly influences the player's choice of Pokémon to add to their team because some of the most useful abilities were exclusive to a small handful or a single Pokémon. Some Pokémon would have abilities that have amazing synergy with the moveset available to that Pokémon. Now throw in Pokémon natures and that will also change how each Pokémon will be used in battle. While the change in stats seems minor, when in a competition with a level playing field that 10% difference can be the variable that decides the outcome of a battle. Then add in the 2 vs 2 format of Pokémon battles and team composition will be much more difficult to learn, let alone master. All the above combined with the total amount of Pokémon at the time (386) and the list of possible moves, strategies, etc. far exceeds that of chess. Which is why I loved Pokémon even more with this generation.<br><br>Aside from the competitive scene, the game as a whole is so beautifully developed. The higher resolution pixel art and sound design adding more life to Pokémon. The soundtrack paired with the vibrant design of the environment creating a memorable experience overall. Just the Elite Four and Champion tracks alone are such a nostalgic trip because I loved to listen to each track in it's entirety while becoming champion for the hundredth time.<br><br>Also the amount of activities to do postgame were very fun and challenging. The Battle Tower seemingly impossible after hitting a certain streak but still inpiring ideas for different team compositions to use in competitive play. Also the extra items exclusive to the shop within the tower were definitely worth grinding for (mostly for hardcore players). Pokémon contests also a great addition for completionists because they do reward the player's Pokémon with ribbons (purely cosmetic) which you can flex to other players.<br><br>These are just the main reasons why I love this generation of Pokémon when compared to all other generations. There are a few other games outside of the core series that I thoroughly enjoyed from this generation but require a bit more background knowledge to understand.</p>
